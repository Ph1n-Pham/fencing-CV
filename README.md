## Introduction

FencingVision is an app designed to revolutionize the analysis of fencing videos using the cutting-edge capabilities of computer vision. It provides fencers, coaches, and enthusiasts with an advanced toolset to extract valuable insights from recorded fencing bouts. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, FencingVision aims to enhance training, improve performance, and elevate the overall understanding of the sport.

## Features

- **Fencing Action Recognition**: Automatically detect and classify different fencing actions, such as attacks, parries, ripostes, and more, within a video sequence.

- **Fencer Performance Evaluation**: Analyze fencer technique, timing, and footwork to provide detailed performance metrics, such as accuracy, speed, reaction time, and balance.

- **Fencing Bout Summaries**: Generate concise summaries of fencing bouts, including highlights, key moments, scoring patterns, and statistical data.

- **Training Recommendations**: Based on the analysis of individual fencer performance, provide personalized training recommendations and drills to address weaknesses and improve overall skills.

- **Annotation and Tagging**: Annotate videos with labels, tags, and notes to enable easy organization, search, and retrieval of specific fencing sequences or training sessions.

- **Real-time Analysis**: Perform live analysis of fencing bouts by connecting a video feed directly to FencingVision, allowing instant feedback and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To set up FencingVision on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the FencingVision repository from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fencing-vision.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the pre-trained models and weights necessary for running FencingVision. You can find the download link in the `weights/best.pt` file.

### Usage

Once you have completed the installation process, you can start using FencingVision. Follow these steps:

1. Launch the FencingVision app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Upload a fencing video for analysis. Supported formats include MP4, AVI, and MOV.

3. Wait for the analysis to complete. The duration depends on the length and complexity of the video.

4. Explore the results! View the action recognition labels, performance metrics, bout summaries, and training recommendations.

## How It Works

FencingVision employs a combination of computer vision techniques, machine learning models, and deep neural networks to analyze fencing videos. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Video Input**: FencingVision takes a recorded video of a fencing bout as input.

2. **Video Preprocessing**: The video is preprocessed to enhance quality, stabilize the frames, and reduce noise, ensuring optimal analysis conditions.

3. **Action Recognition**: Using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, FencingVision recognizes and classifies various fencing actions, identifying attacks, parries, ripostes, and other essential elements of the bout.

4. **Performance Evaluation**: Based on the detected actions, FencingVision evaluates the fencer's technique, timing, and footwork, generating insightful performance metrics.

5. **Bout Summaries**: FencingVision creates concise summaries of the fencing bout, highlighting key moments, scoring patterns, and statistical data.

6. **Training Recommendations**: Leveraging the performance evaluation results, FencingVision provides personalized training recommendations and drills to help fencers improve specific aspects of their game.

7. **Annotation and Tagging**: FencingVision allows users to annotate videos with labels, tags, and notes, enabling easy organization and retrieval of specific sequences or training sessions.

8. **Real-time Analysis**: By connecting a video feed directly to FencingVision, users can perform live analysis of fencing bouts, receiving instant feedback and evaluation.
